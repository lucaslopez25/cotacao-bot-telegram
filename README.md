# cotacao-bot-telegram
Telegram Bot that (currently only) connects to a currency exchange API and shows time.

Libraries:
pyTelegramBotAPI (3.8.1)
requests (2.25.1)
pytz (2021.1)

Please note that the Api Key is registered on 'apikey.py', imported as 'apikey', which is not included on the repository.
If you try this bot at home remember to create apikey.py as a separate file and put the token in there. Remember to put it
on .gitignore if you are working in a git repo in order to not commit the file.

This bot isn't ready yet but it should be contactable at @inf032_cotacao_bot in Telegram
